# Legoino Quickstart Tutorial

This is a quickstart step by step tutorial which will guide you to the first legoino project running on your ESP32 board. 

## Step 1: Buy an ESP32 board
To use the library you need an ESP32 microcontroller board which has build in Bluetooth. You can find dozens of suppliers of ESP32 boards. I have the following boards and have had good experiences with it.
* M5 Atom matrix or M5 Atom light (1st choice) [https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-atom/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-atom/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit)
* Heltec Wifi Kit 32 (2nd choice with build in OLED display)

## Step 2: Install the Arduino IDE
To develop your application you have to download the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Just open the following link and scroll down to the Development Environment section and choose the version which fits to your operating system
[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
After the download, just install the tool

## Step 4: Install the Legoino Library
To use the Legoino library in the Arduino environment you have to install it with the Arduino Library Manager. You can find it in the Tools Menu. Open the library manager and search for `legoino` Select Install with the latest version. A popup window will appear which shows you the depentend library NimBLE-Arduino. Just select `Install all` to be prepared for you first sketch.

## Step 5: Open Example Sketch
The easiest way to get a project up an running is to open an example provided by the library itself. You can open the examples of installed libraries via the `File` Menu.  In the `Examples` item you can scroll down to `Legoino` and can open the `TrainHub` example. Thats the easiest example with an [LEGOÂ® Powered Up (88009) Hub](https://www.lego.com/product/hub-88009)
![Open Example Sketch](Open_Example_Sketch.gif)

After you have opend the sketch, you can press the arrow button on the top left to compile and upload your sketch to the ESP32 board. Before you will do this, select your Board in the Board manager and select the USB (Serial) Port where your board is connected. 

Now your sketch is uploaded to your ESP32 board and the TrainHub Example will run on your device. Now you can open the Serial Monitor to see messages via the USB(Serial) connection. If you press the hub button the device will automatically connect. The Hub LED will switch the color and a connected Motor on Port A will be turn forward and backward.

# Your first own sketch

After you have successfully run the first example you can go one step further and make some adaptions or your own sketch. It ist strongly dependent on what you will do but the following basic building blocks are normally needed.

## Decide which Hub you want to connect
The sketch setup is dependent on the Hub or Hubs you like to connect. You have to add the Header files `*.h` of the Hub types you want to add on the top of your sketch. Addtionally you need a so called instance of that Hub to access the functions of that hub. 

In the following table you see the mapping which Hub type needs which Header file. Additionally you see how to create an instance of your Hub.


| Hubtype        | Needed Header file include          | Create Hub instance  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| PoweredUp (Train) #88009      | `#include "PoweredUpHub.h"` | `PoweredUpHub myHub;` |
| MoveHub (Boost, StarWars) #88006      | `#include "MoveHub.h"` | `MoveHub myHub;` |
| ControlPlusHub (Lego Technic) #88012      | `#include "ControlPlusHub.h"` | `ControlPlusHub myHub;` |
| Duplo Train Hub #10874, #10875      | `#include "DuploTrainHub.h"` | `DuploTrainHub myHub;` |
| PoweredUp Remote #88010      | `#include "PoweredUpRemoteHub.h"` | `PoweredUpRemoteHub myHub;` |

Select your Hub and dependent on the selection add the following lines in the top of your sketch

```c
#include "MoveHub.h"

MoveHub myHub;
```

## Add a connection procedure

To setup a connection to your hub, the Hub instance has to be initialized. This will trigger a Scan procedure to look if a Lego Hub is active. If the library found an active hub, it will read out his data (Hub Address, Hub Name, etc.) and changes the state to `myHub.isConnecting() == true` 

Now you are ready to connect to the hub with the command `myHub.connectHub();`

If the library changes the state to `myHub.isConnected() == true` you are ready to go and do some cool stuff :grin:


In the ```setup``` part of your Arduino sketch, just initialize your Hub
```c
myHub.init();
```

In the main ```loop``` just add the following connection flow
```c
  if (myHub.isConnecting()) {
    myHub.connectHub();
    if (myHub.isConnected()) {
      Serial.println("We are now connected to the HUB");
    } else {
      Serial.println("We have failed to connect to the HUB");
    }
  }
```

## Motor/Actuator commands (Basic Motor, Tacho Motor, LED, ...)

If you want to control a motor or e.g. an LED you can find several commands to do that. It is dependent on the device you want to control which command is needed. 

| Device type        | Available commands |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Train motor #88011<br> Simple linear motor #45303<br> Duplo train motor #10874 #10875       | `stopBasicMotor(byte port)`<br>`setBasicMotorSpeed(byte port, int speed)` | 
| Medium linear motor #88008<br>Technic large motor #88013<br> Technic XL motor #88014<br> Build in MoveHub motor #88006      |   `setAccelerationProfile(byte port, int16_t time, int8_t profileNumber)`<br>`setDecelerationProfile(byte port, int16_t time, int8_t profileNumber)`<br>`stopTachoMotor(byte port)`<br>`setTachoMotorSpeed(byte port, int speed)`<br>`setTachoMotorSpeedForTime(byte port, int speed, int16_t time)`<br>`setTachoMotorSpeedForDegrees(byte port, int speed, int32_t degrees)`<br>`setTachoMotorAbsolutePosition(byte port, int speed, int32_t position)`<br>`setTachoMotorEncoderPosition(byte port, int32_t position)`<br> | 
| Hub LEDs     |`setLedColor(Color color)`<br>`setLedRGBColor(char red, char green, char blue)`<br>`setLedHSVColor(int hue, double saturation, double value)`<br>| 

## Sensor usage (Color, Distance, Tilt, ...)

To read in a sensor signal a callback function is registered. 

### Hub value usage (Button, Battery level, ...)

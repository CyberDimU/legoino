# Legoino Quickstart

This is a quicstart step by step tutorial which will guide you to the first legoino project running on your ESP32 board. 

## Step1: Buy ESP32 board
To use the library you need an ESP32 microcontroller board which has build in Bluetooth. You can find dozens of suppliers of ESP32 boards. I have the following boards and have had good experiences with it.
* M5 Atom matrix or M5 Atom light (1st choice) [https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-atom/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-atom/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit)
* Heltec Wifi Kit 32 (2nd choice with build in OLED display)

## Step2: Install Arduino IDE
To develop your application you have to download the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Just open the following link and scroll down to the Development Environment section and choose the version which fits to your operating system
